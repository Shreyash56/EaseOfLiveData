Now Create one Interface for API Request.
Here are the example of POST and GET Method

I hope that you are aware with Retrofit Data parsing.

* first one is Post method that you have to pass data and through which you are getting the responce.

    @FormUrlEncoded
    @POST(APIConst.url of service)
    Observable<LoginResponse> loginUser(@Field( APIConst.UNAME )String uname,
                                        @Field( APIConst.PASS )String pass);


* this second is Get method here you not need to pass any parameter, call checkDate() function and you will get result for the given api service. Make sure that
you are not using here  @FormUrlEncoded in Get Method otherwise you getting error.

    @GET(APIConst.url of Service)
    Observable<DateResponse> checkDate();
    
    
    
Befor passing LoginResponse to the Services you have to create that class. This class is used for Retrofit Data parsing.

like
public class LoginResponse {

    @SerializedName("status")
    @Expose
    int status;

    @SerializedName("message")
    @Expose
    String message;
    
}

public int getStatus() {
        return status;
    }

    public void setStatus(int status) {
        this.status = status;
    }

    public String getMessage() {
        return message;
    }

    public void setMessage(String message) {
        this.message = message;
    }
    
Same things you have to create for DateResponse class or whatever data you have to pass.
